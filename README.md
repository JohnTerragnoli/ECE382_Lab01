============

#Purpose

The purpose for this lab is to create a simple calculator using assembly language.  It will perform the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and clearing, as well as ending the program.  The program will run into an error loop if it is not fed the opcode for one of it's designed operations.  Additionally, when the result of an operation is above or below the range, the computer will record the result as 0xFF and 0x00, respectively, which are the numberical limits of the program.  


#Prelab

Below is the flowchart that was drawn before any coding was done.  The purpose for this was to get an idea of how the program would run to avoid confusion during the actual creation of the program.  It is written in pseudocode.  The start of the program is on top and the end of it is on the bottom.
